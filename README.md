# Global Population Analysis Project

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global population trends, focusing on population distribution, growth rates, and population density. The analysis leverages Python for data processing and visualization, and Power BI for an interactive dashboard, offering deep insights into population data across various countries.

### Data Source:

  Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arpitsinghaiml/world-population

### Data Cleaning:

The dataset underwent a data cleaning process to ensure accuracy and consistency.

  •	Dropping rows with missing values in critical columns (country, Year, Population).
  
  •	Converting data types for columns like Year, Population, and density.
  
  •	Displaying statistical summaries to understand data characteristics.


### Python Visualizations:
Several visualizations were generated in Python to provide insights into population trends:

#### 1.	Population Distribution by Country:
A bar chart that displays the top 10 most populous countries in the most recent year of the dataset.

#### 2.	Population Growth Trends:
A line chart tracking population growth over time for the top 5 most populous countries.

#### 3.	Population Density Map:
A choropleth map visualizing population density by country, using color gradients to show density levels.

These visualizations help to highlight population trends and density variations across countries.

### Power BI Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize key metrics and trends

#### •	Line Chart:
Population Growth Over Time: Shows population trends over time for selected countries.

#### •	Map:
An interactive map providing a geographical overview of population data by country.

#### •	Pie Charts:

 **Population by Country :** Shows the population distribution among different countries.
  
  **Land Area by Country:** Highlights the land area distribution across countries.
  
  **Growth Rate by Country:** Compares growth rates among various countries.
  
  **World Population Percentage by Country:** Illustrates each country's share of the global population.

The Power BI dashboard provides an engaging way to explore the data and draw insights interactively. 

### Requirements:
  
  **•	Python libraries:** numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
  
  **•	Power BI Desktop** to view the Power BI dashboard file.
